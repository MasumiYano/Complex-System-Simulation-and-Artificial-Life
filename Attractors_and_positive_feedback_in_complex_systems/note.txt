################################################ Dynamical Systems ################################################
It is a subset of complex systems research. 

Dynamical systems: The mathematical heavy field. It studies the dynamic (changes over time) of complex systems. 

In this field, the concept of attractor is state or set of state that complex systems tends to evolve over time. 

Example: Pendulum swinging -> attractor state can be the pendulum at rest. Bc it tends to slow down (attracted to slow down, evolve to rest) over time. 
When system is attracted to a single state, we call it a fixed-point attractor.


################################################ Fixed-pointer ################################################

FIXED-POINTER IS A SINGLE STATE. Like jump (try to escape from attractor, earth) 
An attractor's basin of attraction is the set of initial states that evolve to that attractor. 

Positive (negative) feedback occurs when the occurrence of an event increases (decreases) the likelihood or number of occurrences of the same event in the future. 

Example: Fixed-point attractor -> Colorado river. Basin of attraction -> any rain that falls within the Grand Canyon. 
	 So the any rain will eventually be part of Colorado river. 
	 Positive Feedback: the river used to be just a narrow line of water. Over time, it dig out deeper path. And that increased the likelihood that more water would flow down that path. 

BUT!!!!! Most attracts are not fixed-point attractors. It is more likely that attractors repeats a series of states. We call it LIMIT CYCLE.

################################################ Limit Cycle ################################################
Limit Cycle: An attractor that repeats a set of states. 

Example: Solar systems -> Planet repeatedly orbits around sun. Or season repeating, sates of season changes due to earth rotates, and earth orbits around sun. 

In a feud of dynamical systems there's also a chaos. And if it's the case, then the attractor we will get won't be simple fixed-point or simple cycle. We call those attractor a FRACTAL STRUCTURE

################################################ Fractal Structure ################################################ ??? 
Fractal Structure: Something that has same structure or repeated structure at different scales.  Strange attractor has a fractal structure. If we zoom-in our out infinitely, we will see the same structure.
