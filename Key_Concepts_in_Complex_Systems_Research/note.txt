################################################ Complexity ################################################
Complexity: Complex systems don't yield to analytic predictability like simple isolated systems. 

Example: Calculate the ball that is free falling from building. -> Can predict where it is, but need bit of analysis. 

We can't predict the place of sun like millions years from now. The only thing we can is just to wait millions years and see. 
There's no way we can predict it. 

But, why??? Because complex system displays what we call non-linearity. 

################################################ Non-Linearity ################################################
Non-linearity: Complex system have (non-linear) differences depending on differences in context or environmental conditions. 

Every system in this world has a context or environmental conditions. And they are important to the behavior of the complex system. 
non-linear: one condition and another condition that is similar to each other, given amount of time, the differences between tow is no longer a linear function.

These non linear difference is called Chaos. 

################################################ Chaos ################################################
Chaos: The behavior of a complex system is sensitive to small differences in initial conditions. 


################################################ Emergence and Self-Organization ################################################
Emergence: quote from Aristotle says "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts." like duh ðŸ™„

Self-organization: The ability for order to emerge from the chaos. 
            -> In the chaotic environment, among the chaos order can arise spontaneously. Then it can organize themselves into simple system.
